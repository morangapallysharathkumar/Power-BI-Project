### Customer Churn Analysis: Power BI Project
This repository contains a comprehensive Customer Churn Analysis project developed using Power BI. The project identifies key reasons why customers leave a service and provides data-driven recommendations to improve retention. 



### Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical metric for any subscription-based business, as the cost of acquiring new customers often exceeds the cost of retaining existing ones. This project uses a "leaky bucket" analogy to visualize how and why customers are leaving and uses data to "plug the leaks." 



### Key Objectives

Identify Churn Drivers: Determine the primary reasons for customer attrition (e.g., service types, contract lengths). 



Predictive Insights: Provide a framework to predict which customers are at risk. 



Retention Strategy: Recommend actionable steps to increase customer loyalty. 


### Dataset Summary
The analysis is based on a dataset containing information for 7,043 customers with 21 different attributes, including: 


Demographics: Gender, senior citizen status, and family details. 


Services: Phone, high-speed internet (DSL/Fiber Optic), and streaming habits. 



Account Info: Tenure (how long they've stayed), contract types, and billing methods. 




Financials: Monthly charges and total spending. 

### Data Preparation
Before visualization, the data underwent a rigorous cleaning process in Power BI: 

Fixed 11 missing price entries. 

Converted text-based numerical data into mathematical formats. 

Removed empty spaces and validated that there were no duplicate records. 

Grouped tenure and monthly charges for better trend analysis. 


### Key Insights & Findings
The analysis revealed several "Service Secrets" and "Money Matters" that drive churn: 


The Churn Rate: The overall churn rate sits at 26.54%. 



Contract Risks: Customers on month-to-month plans are significantly more likely to leave compared to those on one- or two-year contracts. 



Service Dissatisfaction: Fiber Optic users show a higher rate of leaving, suggesting potential service quality or pricing issues. 



Technical Support: Customers with no technical support have a much higher churn rate. 



Loyalty Gap: New customers (under 6 months) are at the highest risk of leaving. 



Payment Methods: Users paying via electronic check churn more frequently than those on automatic payments. 


### Recommendations
To reduce churn and save revenue, the following strategies are proposed: 


Incentivize Long-term Contracts: Offer rewards or discounts for moving away from month-to-month billing. 



Proactive Support: Provide free tech help to all users to improve satisfaction. 


New Customer Onboarding: Send "welcome gifts" or check-ins during the first few months to build loyalty. 


Promote Automation: Encourage customers to switch to automatic payment methods to improve retention.
